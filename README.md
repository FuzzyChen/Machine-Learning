# Machine-Learning

This is all machine learning project I have ever done. Here are the codes and reports

# CS6930 Final Project 2018

This project is to predict the probability of patients' readimission.
The python code mainly focus on the following things:

- Preprocessed raw data with missing value, categorical variable and imbalanced result by Python
- Split data to test/train and applied cross validation with different models such as Random Forest, SVM by scikit-learn
- Visualized all results with line chart and bar diagram in Python matplotlib

## 5800 Final Project

We wrote our own neural net by Numpy while testing with neural net by Pytorch.

## PySpark

Udemy Spark and Python for Big Data with PySpark
After taking Big Data Programming, I took this course form the Udemy to supplement my experience in Machine Learning with Spark and Hadoop
